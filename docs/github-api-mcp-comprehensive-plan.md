## 1. Introduction and Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The GitHub API MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides full access to GitHub data through a standardized interface. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the requirements and implementation of the GitHub API MCP server, combining the requirements specification, implementation plan, and technical architecture into a single, cohesive reference.

The scope of this document encompasses:
- Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- Technical specifications and architecture
- Implementation approach and strategy
- Development roadmap and timeline
- Comprehensive API endpoint references

This document is intended for developers, architects, project managers, and stakeholders involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of the GitHub API MCP server.

### 1.2 Background

GitHub provides a comprehensive REST API that enables programmatic access to nearly all GitHub features, including repositories, issues, pull requests, users, and more. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized interface for AI models to access external tools and resources. By implementing a GitHub API MCP server, we enable AI models to seamlessly interact with GitHub data and functionality.

The GitHub API MCP server will act as a bridge between MCP clients (such as AI models) and the GitHub API, providing a consistent interface for accessing GitHub data while handling authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and other complexities of the GitHub API.

### 1.3 Key Objectives

The key objectives of the GitHub API MCP server are:

1. **Complete GitHub API Coverage**: Implement all GitHub API endpoints to provide full access to GitHub data.
2. **Standardized Interface**: Provide a consistent interface for MCP clients to access GitHub data.
3. **Robust Authentication**: Securely handle GitHub authentication using Personal Access Tokens.
4. **Efficient Performance**: Minimize latency and optimize throughput for GitHub API requests.
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Design a horizontally scalable architecture to handle increasing load.
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for developers and users.
7. **Containerized Deployment**: Package the server as a Docker container for easy deployment.

                       +------------------+
```

### 4.2 Component Design

#### HTTP Server

The HTTP server will be implemented using the Go standard library's `net/http` package. It will handle incoming HTTP requests, route them to the appropriate handler, and return responses to clients. The server will support HTTPS and will be configurable via environment variables.

#### MCP Protocol Handler

The MCP Protocol Handler will implement the Model Context Protocol and handle MCP-specific requests. It will map MCP tool invocations to GitHub API endpoints and convert GitHub API responses to MCP resource formats. The handler will also implement the MCP authentication and authorization system.

#### GitHub API Client

The GitHub API Client will communicate with the GitHub API and handle authentication, rate limiting, and error handling. It will use the Go standard library's `net/http` package for HTTP requests and will support all HTTP methods used by the GitHub API. The client will also implement retry logic for transient errors and backoff strategies for rate limiting.

#### Cache

The Cache will store GitHub API responses to improve performance and reduce API calls. It will respect GitHub's cache headers and use conditional requests to validate cached responses. The cache will be configurable via environment variables and will support clearing and bypassing the cache.

#### Configuration

The Configuration component will manage server configuration from environment variables, configuration files, and command-line flags. It will validate configuration values and provide meaningful error messages for invalid configuration. The configuration will be documented and will support both required and optional configuration options.

#### Logging

The Logging component will provide structured logging for debugging and monitoring. It will support different log levels and output formats and will be configurable via environment variables. The logging will include request and response details, performance metrics, and error information.

#### Metrics

The Metrics component will collect and expose metrics for monitoring and alerting. It will track request counts, response times, error rates, cache hit rates, and other performance metrics. The metrics will be exposed via an HTTP endpoint and will be compatible with Prometheus.

### 4.3 Data Flow

The data flow through the GitHub API MCP server will be as follows:

1. A client sends an MCP request to the HTTP server.
2. The HTTP server routes the request to the MCP Protocol Handler.
3. The MCP Protocol Handler authenticates and authorizes the request.
4. The MCP Protocol Handler maps the MCP request to a GitHub API request.
5. The GitHub API Client checks the cache for a cached response.
6. If a cached response is available and valid, the GitHub API Client returns the cached response.
7. If no cached response is available or the cached response is invalid, the GitHub API Client sends a request to the GitHub API.
8. The GitHub API Client handles rate limiting and retries if necessary.
9. The GitHub API Client receives a response from the GitHub API.
10. The GitHub API Client caches the response if appropriate.
11. The MCP Protocol Handler maps the GitHub API response to an MCP response.
12. The HTTP server returns the MCP response to the client.

### 4.4 API Design

The GitHub API MCP server will expose two types of APIs:

1. **MCP API**: Implements the Model Context Protocol for AI models to access GitHub data.
2. **Management API**: Provides endpoints for managing the server, such as health checks, metrics, and configuration.

#### MCP API

The MCP API will follow the Model Context Protocol specification and will provide the following endpoints:

- `POST /tools`: Invoke a GitHub API tool.
- `GET /resources/{uri}`: Access a GitHub API resource.

#### Management API

The Management API will provide the following endpoints:

- `GET /health`: Check the health of the server.
- `GET /metrics`: Get server metrics.
- `GET /config`: Get server configuration.
- `POST /cache/clear`: Clear the cache.

### 4.5 Security Architecture

The security architecture of the GitHub API MCP server will include:

1. **Authentication**: The server will authenticate clients using token-based authentication.
2. **Authorization**: The server will authorize client requests based on the client's permissions.
3. **Encryption**: The server will use HTTPS for all communication with clients and the GitHub API.
4. **Input Validation**: The server will validate all client input to prevent injection attacks.
5. **Secure Configuration**: The server will securely handle sensitive configuration values, such as the GitHub PAT.
6. **Audit Logging**: The server will log security-relevant events for auditing purposes.

### 4.6 Error Handling Architecture

The error handling architecture of the GitHub API MCP server will include:

1. **Error Types**: The server will define a set of error types for different categories of errors.
2. **Error Context**: The server will include context information in error messages to aid debugging.
3. **Error Logging**: The server will log errors with appropriate severity levels.
4. **Error Responses**: The server will return standardized error responses to clients.
5. **Retry Logic**: The server will implement retry logic for transient errors.
6. **Panic Recovery**: The server will recover from panics and return appropriate error responses.

### 4.7 Caching Architecture

The caching architecture of the GitHub API MCP server will include:

1. **Cache Storage**: The server will use an in-memory cache for storing GitHub API responses.
2. **Cache Keys**: The server will use request URLs and headers as cache keys.
3. **Cache Validation**: The server will validate cached responses using ETag and Last-Modified headers.
4. **Cache Control**: The server will respect Cache-Control headers from GitHub API responses.
5. **Cache Bypass**: The server will provide a mechanism for clients to bypass the cache.
6. **Cache Metrics**: The server will track cache hit rates and other cache metrics.
