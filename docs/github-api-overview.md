# GitHub API Documentation: Research Summary for MCP Integration

## Summary

- The **GitHub REST API** enables programmatic access to nearly all GitHub features, including repositories, issues, pull requests, users, and more.
- API documentation is generated from an OpenAPI schema, providing a consistent, navigable, and example-rich reference for all endpoints.
- Requests are made via standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE), with authentication required for most operations.
- Authentication is typically handled via a personal access token, which must be included in the request headers.
- The documentation provides example requests and responses for each endpoint, and uses a three-column layout for clarity and ease of use.

## Details

### API Request Structure

- **HTTP Method:** Defines the action (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PATCH for updates, PUT for replacement, DELETE for removal).
- **Path:** The endpoint URL, e.g., `/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.
- **Headers:** Include authentication (Bearer token) and content type.
- **Media Types:** Specify response format, usually JSON.
- **Parameters:** May be in the path, query string, or request body, depending on the endpoint.

### Authentication

- Most endpoints require authentication via a personal access token, which is generated in your GitHub account settings.
- The token is sent in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.
- Treat tokens as sensitive credentials.

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate authentication and limit token scopes.
- Paginate results for large lists.
- Handle rate limits and errors gracefully.
- Keep API credentials secure.
- Refer to endpoint-specific documentation for required parameters and request/response formats.

### Documentation Structure

- GitHub's REST API documentation uses a three-column layout: navigation, endpoint details, and example requests/responses.
- Example code is available in multiple languages and can be selected via dropdowns.
- The documentation is generated from the OpenAPI schema, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
